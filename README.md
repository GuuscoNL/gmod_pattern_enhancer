# Gmod Pattern Enhancers
This addon adds a transport pattern enhancer entity which can be used to create a transport point. It also includes a pattern enhancer case SWEP that allows you to place and pick up enhancers.

# Usage
1. Equip the Pattern Enhancer Case weapon from the Star Trek weapons tab.
2. Left click to place an enhancer, right click to pick up an enhancer. The case's ammo is how many enhancers you have on you with a limit of 3 total. They will not place on harsh terrain gradients!
3. Press the use key on an enhancer to activate them.
4. Once there is a valid connection between 3 enhancers it will connect and create a transporter location in the external tab of a transporter console.

# Valid connection
- They should form an approximately even triangle.
- They need to be roughly on the same elevation plane.
- There should be no obstructions between the emitter tips.
- There should be no static object obstructing the centre of the emitters.

# Additional Notes
You can use the [STM Handheld Tricorders](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858563573) to scan active pattern enhancers to discover their transport point name!
